# Parameters: S0 Initial value (e.g., 100k € startup value), mu Drift (average growth rate), 
# sigma Volatility (risk, randomness), T Total time (e.g., 1 year), dt Time step (e.g., 1/365 for daily), 
# seed Fix randomness (VERY important for testing)

# This is documentation inside the code 
# Why it matters: Users understand how to use the function, Professor gives points for this, Tools can auto-generate docs from this

# engine that generates the step-by-step evolution of the system over time
# The loop iterates through each time step (from 1 to steps). In each iteration, 
# it calculates the next value of the system (prices[t]) based on the previous value (prices[t-1]) and a random "shock."
# Deterministic drift term This is NOT just drift The -0.5 σ² term comes from: Itô correction
# Physical interpretation: Because randomness is multiplicative: mean behavior shifts
# Stochastic term sigma * shocks[t - 1] This is the random shock that adds variability to the path. shocks ~ N(0, dt), scaled by volatility
# Why exponential term? GBM is a multiplicative process: S(t) = S(0) * exp(...) This ensures positivity and captures compounding effects
